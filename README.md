# Autonomous Line-Following Robot with Red Object and Junction Detection 🚗📷


This repository contains the software for an autonomous robot developed as part of a college project involving 14 team members, including 4 key developers. The robot uses PiCamera2 and OpenCV for real-time image processing to follow a black line, detect red objects, and handle cross junctions. It is controlled via a RockyBorg motor controller on a Raspberry Pi.
